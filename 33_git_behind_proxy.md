# The Way of Getting Github.com Access Through Our Own HTTP Proxy

Since yesterday afternoon, we found that the access to github.com suddenly lost, through some un-official source, we think itâ€™s due to the GFW. Now we tested a solution to get the github.com access back with our own HTTP proxy.

First please install the `ncat`/`socat` tool, with 

- `pacman -S/yum|apt|brew|choco install nmap-ncat/ncat/nmap`

- `pacman -S/yum|apt|brew install socat`

Then put the following configuration into the file `~/.ssh/config`(if there is no the file, you should create it by hand.):

```conf
Host github.com
	Hostname github.com
	ServerAliveInterval 55
	ForwardAgent yes
	ProxyCommand /usr/bin/ncat --proxy 192.168.30.51:3128 %h %p
    # ProxyCommand /usr/bin/socat - PROXY:192.168.30.51:%h:%p,proxyport=3128
```

If any question, please feel free to contact Ryan or me.
